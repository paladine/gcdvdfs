# gcdvdfs

This is a fusefs port of my gcdvdfs filesystem kernel driver I wrote for the
[Gamecube Linux project](http://sourceforge.net/projects/gc-linux/). It allows you to mount uncompressed
Gamecube ISO files as a read-only filesystem. Should be feature complete and compatible with all Linux flavors.

## How do I build it?

Use [bazel](http://bazel.io)
